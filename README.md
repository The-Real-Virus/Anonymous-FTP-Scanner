## ⚙️Troubleshooting
1) `Python Compatibility:` Ensure you are using Python 3.7 or higher.  

2) `Dependencies:` The script uses ftplib and os, which are part of the Python standard library. No external installations are required.  

3) `Connection Errors:`  
- Ensure the server is reachable.  
- Verify the hostname or IP address is correct.  
- Check for firewalls or network restrictions that may block FTP access.  

4) `Timeouts:` If the connection hangs, increase your network reliability or check the server's status.  

## 🤝Follow the Prompts !
1) Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:  

2) View the banner and choose to continue or exit by typing y or n.  

3) Enter the hostname or IP address of the FTP server to test for anonymous login.  

4) Review the results displayed after each test.  

5) Test multiple servers or type exit to quit the program.
